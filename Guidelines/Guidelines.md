# VisiMedia OSS Guidelines

## Purpose

This document will act as a central repository for the current policies and guidelines surrounding the production and use of OSS at VisiMedia.

## Licensing 
The recomended license for OSS is the GNU GPL v3.0 or later. In any case, licenses must exempt VisiMedia from any liability. Where there is a business case that code should not be released publicly, the code should remain unlicensed (default copyright applies) and the repository should be private. 

## Accessiblity
Where documentation is required, this should be released in markdown. If documentation is required in another format, an accessible version should **always** be provided. 

### Accessible Versions
PDFs should meet PDF/A standards. 
Where a user may not reasonably be able to change font or colour settings, a copy of the document must be available in the OpenDyslexic3 font. The font can be downloaded from [here](https://opendyslexic.org/). The colours of a document should be high-contrast at least 4.5:1, such as black text on a yellow background. A colour contrast checker can be found [here](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

# Branch Naming
**The primary branch for any repository should be named `main`.** Never use `master` as a branch name.

Branches should be named in the following format: `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/bug-name`. Where a branch is a hotfix, the branch should be named `hotfix/hotfix-name`.
